The Code from work folder contains approved parts of three work projects I completed. 


The Uni projects folder contains a sample of some of the projects I've completed at uni.

Venner was my latest university project. I had 2 weeks to create a social media site.
The user can login/logout. Upload posts, see friends post, add/block friends and a real time chat system.
The site uses plain php, Jquery and MySql for the db. For this project I got a 12.

The car-site was also one of my latest projects. I user should be able to pick an air port, date/time for drop off and pick up.
Then pick the car they'd like to hire, see the total price and got a confirmation email.
Again this site uses plain php, Jquery and MySql for the db. For this project I got a 10.
