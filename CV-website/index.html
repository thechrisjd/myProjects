            People are like onions, their layers and layers of complexity.
            There are things people love, hate and the epic history that made them.
            I'd have to be either above or below humanity to say I was different.
            Here you can get a snippet of the story that made me and a sense of the person I am today!

          However, Rome wasn't built-in a day! So for now, I'd like to finish my degree in the next six months,
          finish my CompTIA certificates (Security+) and lastly but most importantly,
          I'd like to build up my family and move forward with my personal relationships.

            Shortly after being born in South Africa,
            I moved to England where I learnt, accomplished and experienced many things.
            For example, at the age of sixteen, I was sent to Cambridge university to undergo advanced mathematic courses.
            Moreover, I also tested an HSBC stock market simulation program.
            Lastly, I took part in a program called young enterprise,
            which is where I set up and ran a company for a year and competed against other people.
            All these experiences and more has helped me to develop a strong work ethic,
            fast learning skills, quick thinking and the self motivation.

              When it comes to working and being around other people I'm very relaxed,
              I'm not the type of person to force or annoy others.
              This is because there are many things I like, few things I love and little I hate.
              In fact, there are only four things I hate: violence, ignorance, laziness and people talking down to me.
              What I like is far too long and numerous to write here, so I'll just name a few:
              honesty, passion, pride in ones work and cleanliness.

                I have found memories of watching Dragon Ball Z as a child growing up in South Africa,
                and as an adult, this love has transformed into a love of anime, manga and comics in general
                I also have a great passion for gym-ing (I am a certified personal trainer), I go 5-6 times a week.
                Furthermore, I love to play chess! I play 2-3 games per day for me,
                I feel it's very important to stimulate and sharpen the mind and there's nothing better at that than chess.
                I have many more passions like reading and studying (philosophy and history) to cooking and traveling,
                as in the end of the day passion is the spice of life.

            Currently I'm at university obtaining my degree in web development. The course is split up into three parts: web design, database design and user interface. In web design we are focusing on html, css, php, JavaScript (jQuery and node.js), and python (Django). Through proper web design we seek to build robust full stack web sites. For database design we are creating/administrating JSON databases, MySQL, MariaDB and MongoDB. Finally, interface design focuses on the paper work involed in creating a website. We implement scrum, kanban and other project management techniques to make sure we forfill the customers requirements. <br> <br>
            Furthermore, I have an AP degree in IT tech. This of course is made up of three parts programming, networking and server administration. In server administration, we set up multiple virtual networks and implemented server software to maintain the domain, manage users/groups through OU structures, manage the logical topology through sites and manage security/permissions. In most cases we are using a virtual windows environment (2003, 2003 R2, 2008 and 2012), however, in some instances, we used Linux servers. The virtualization software I use is VMware workstation and Virtual box. In the networking part of my course were taught the OSI model (the 7 layers of the internet), the different protocols that reside in each layer, how to perform packet capturing with Cisco packet sniffer/wire shark and how to configure network deceives like routers and switches. The programming languages I learnt were processing, python 3, JavaScript, C and C#. Finally, I also have my comptia network + certificate.

            I am working at Zara as a shop floor assistant, this entails a lot of customer contact.
            However, I'm looking to develop my career in a specific area as I'm currently a jack of all trades master of none.
            My favourite area to specify in would be network security or programming,
            as I like the balance between hands on work and theoretical ideas.
            <br>
            <br>
            From 2017 to 2018 I worked on a project alongside a company based in Aarhus called SARTA.
            The project we worked on together was an automatic pill dispensing device,
            the idea was to integrate my device with their hub system to help elderly individuals to take their medicine on time.

          <!-- Side projects I'm currently doing -->
          <h3 class="Other_title"> Side projects</h3>
          <p class="Other_text">
            In my spare time I like playing and experimenting with Arduino and Resbery PI.
            I've completed several projects such as a Bluetooth controlled car and smart plug;
            both these devices were controlled through an app I made.
            The current project I'm working on is a smart self watering plant pot.
            I first got into programing because I wanted to learn how to make games;
            I did this by learning python through the module pygame.
            Later I moved onto other python modules like Tkinter, which is a GUI maker.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm now studying for and about to take my CompTIA Security+ cert.
            In April 2018 I started to teach myself front end web development;
            I did this in a number of stages.
            Firstly, I learnt html and proper semantic structure of the DOM.
            I then moved onto CSS and learnt many styling tools and page layout tools like flexbox and grid.
            Finally. I learnt how to integrate JavaScript and add responsive design.
            This website is a coming together of all the tools and ideas I learnt in the last 2 months;
            I learnt how to do front end web development from watching videos on lynda.com.
